# Token Bridge User Interface (UI) Application

A DApp interface to transfer assets between networks running the Token Bridge contracts.

Due to reorganization of the token bridge repos into one monorepo the sources of the token bridge UI was moved to [the TokenBridge repo](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge).

What does it mean for you? If you would like
  * to raise an issue against the UI, follow [this link](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/issues/new).
  * to find if a new version of the UI is ready in the monorepo, visit [the releases tab](https://github.com/poanetwork/tokenbridge/releases).
  * to get access to the last changes made in this repo, check the release [`2.1.1`](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-ui/releases/tag/2.1.1) or the [`master`](https://github.com/poanetwork/bridge-ui/tree/master) branch.

If you still have no clear understanding what you need to do, please visit [the TokenBridge forum](https://forum.poa.network/c/tokenbridge) and raise your question there.
